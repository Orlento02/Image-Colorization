# Image-Colorization
#### This is a simple implementation of Colorization using pix-2-pix method following is the results of the colorization. Basically pretrained resnet-18 models were used for generator step. And cocolab 20000 datasets were used for finetuing the generator network. The following is an example of the outputs. The inference.py receives the input image in the input folder and generates outputs accroding to the pretrained weight images.
